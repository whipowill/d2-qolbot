        "If you wanted sherry, you might have brought your own.",
        "You clear the next section. My body cries for repose.",

        "Cease your shrill laughter. I am getting a headache.",
        "I will finish the food. You're all too fat as it is.",
        "Try to sleep, you say? Out here?! AH HA HA HAAAAA!",
        "Pass the drink. My sores need cleansing.",
        "Now... I must rest. Please keep quiet.",
        "Silence! I need rest to maintain my strength!",
        "Any artifacts we find should go to the university...",
        "Give me all your candles. I require them for my rituals.",
        "I am out of moustache wax. Let's make this quick.",
        "I bear the brunt of our troubles, and should be rewarded accordingly.",
        "That's a nasty cough. Let me collect the spittle.",
        "Urinate in this flask. No, you're fine -- I just need it.",
        "I alone hold this pitiful group together.",
        "Yes, ten percent for the church! This was discussed!",
        "Give your share to the Light and all will be forgiven.",
        "Let me rest so I can save your worthless hides on the morrow.",
        "Pray I am still here to guide you when you awaken.",
        "Quit moaning, left you plenty of stew.",
        "I'll sleep closest to the fire.",
        "I barely have enough tincture for myself.",
        "Sort the watches between you, I deserve a night's rest.",
        "Of course we're out of meat.  Have you seen the size of my dog?",
        "Put out that pipe! You'll foul the hound's nose for the trail!",
        "I have no control over where the dog does its business!",
        "Give me that! I eat for two.",
        "Keep silent, I must focus to soothe the other.",
        "How can it be my fault? I have no control over it!",
        "I did not think you would mind if I had some extra.",
        "Oh, dear me, I only brought enough for myself.",
        "Your games and cheer keep me from sleep!",

        "You! It was you all along!",
        "Backstabbing liar!",
        "Been waiting for this moment!",

        "I will not sit idly by and wait for your betrayal!",
        "I can smell deceit. I've lived among much worse than you!",
        "Perhaps this will encourage loyalty!",
        "I see demons peering from behind your eyes!",
        "Traitorous viper!",
        "Flee betrayer!",
        "Yes, I know your plots!",
        "I spied you tampering with my weapon!",
        "Let's see you try something now!",
        "The hound can sense your deceit!",
        "You!  Conspirator!",
        "Consider this a warning from my better half!",
        "Did you think I would wait for you to act against us?",
        "A little blood should warn off the rest of you vultures!",
        "Now you know better than to stalk the hunter!",
        "I led you to believe that you were the one stalking me!",
        "Don't presume to act surprised! Traitor!",
        "This is how one survives countless conspiracies!",
        "Weakling, coward!",
        "(spits) There's what I think of this \"alliance.\"",

        "You simpering cockerel. I've about had it with you!",
        "En garde! You shall assault my senses no longer!",
        "None but beast should walk this land. I will cleanse it!",
        "Ab'rokhan dahry cho'lem, you stinking rat!",

        "... I'll be just fine. Best attend to the others.",
        "... You try it first. I know poison when I see it.",
        "I would doubt me also, but I KNOW you're up to no good.",
        "You seem to extend my suffering? How cruel.",

        "What, that? It's a trifle. Carry on.",
        "What reason is there for living, if not excruciating pain?",
        "Bah. Another day, another life-threatening injury.",
        "Pay me no mind, child. Death is only an inconvenience.",
        "No thank you, I barely feel it.",
        "No thank you. I rather like a little self-torture.",
        "STAY BACK, OR I WILL CRUSH YOU. THIS FOOL MUST DIE.",
        "I can heal myself, thank you.",
        "Stop! I am testing a theory!",
        "I thrive on pain. It's the way of my order.",
        "Let me endure it a bit first. It rejuvenates my soul.",
        "Pain is all I need.",
        "Soldiers live to suffer!",
        "What glory is there in begging for aid?",
        "I already feel so alive!",
        "You ignore the virtue of suffering.",
        "There is no better balm than searing wounds!",
        "What logic is there in soothing wounds?",
        "That stitching needle looks too thin.",
        "I requested salt for my gashes, thank you.",
        "Will it enhance the pain?",
        "If it doesn't wound, gash, cut or slice, I don't want it.",
        "Hah, a weakling's recourse!",
        "Why delay the inevitable...",
        "Stay back. I'm not worth it...",
        "It's useless! Leave me be!",
        "I cannot accept your mercy. Just go...",
        "If I die from this, it is the Light's judgment.",
        "No, no, please... Just leave me to a spinster's fate!",
        "You lovely fool. Can't you see it's too late?",
        "No. If the spirits will my death, so be it.",
        "(pushes you away) The ancestors call to me. I must go.",
        "No. You see, it's been a long road. Too long, I fear.",
        "Why bother to save me? I am just an old horse.",
        "Why save an old maniac, of no use to anyone?",
        "Just leave me here. I know you would relish my death.",
        "There's no point in easing my pain.",
        "I have lived on the edge of death for years. Why fight now?",
        "If the mind cannot survive this, then I am surely dead.",

        "Thank you, but no. I have my reasons.",
        "Keep your silly incantations to yourself, please.",

        "You seek to prolong my life? What cruelty is this?!",

        "Cease! Your intentions are painfully obvious!",
        "I know medicine...I recognize a knife in the back!",
        "Get away from me! Have you not trained at all?",
        "Thank you, but may I recommend a career as a butcher?",
        "Don't touch me! The Devil works through you!",
        "The Light is quite enough for me, thank you.",
        "I deny your shamanism, kind though it may seem.",
        "So eager to heal me?",
        "This is medicine?!",
        "Such deception.",
        "I'll prepare my own treatments!",
        "That reeks of belladonna.",

        "How can I be sure that is medicine?",
        "Oh suddenly you practice physic?",
        "Tainted and caustic I presume.",
        "What fraud is this?",
        "Such obvious deceit!",
        "I don't want the pain dulled.",
        "I chose this line of work for a reason!",
        "I need your help, I'll bloody well ask for it.",
        "I'm no child. I can suffer pain.",
        "No! The Light commands my pain!",
        "Save your sympathy. This pain is a gift.",
        "Nay. The sight of blood enrages my spirit. Leave it.",
        "Why blunt the sting? It's kept me going thus far.",
        "I love a little punishment; it suits me, like a fine coat.",
        "You lack faith in me? Oh... how disheartening.",
        "Stop... I may lose control of the blood rage...",
        "NO... Every wound and scar is a blessing!",

        "Saving me is a sin. The helpless profane the Light.",
        "Leave me alone. The others need aid more than I.",
        "No. I escaped the gallows once -- never again.",
        "My virtue is already marred. No healing can cure that.",
        "Why offer respite?  For your mocking amusement?",

        "No. I traded fair and square for this...",
        "My wounds are my own.",
        "The cortex has already failed. Why spare the corpus?",

        "Save it for a better soldier.",
        "And what would this pathetic wretch do with that?",
        "Just go away.",
        "There is no cure for corruption of the spirit.",
        "Heal me, you heal the beast.",
        "Best to keep my dark half weakened. It will return soon...",

        "No, thank you. I don't like that glint in your eye.",
        "Keep your greasy fingers to yourself, thank you.",
        "Black majicks! You would poison my pure soul!",
        "It seems like power... but it is surely corruption!",

        "No. I will drown them in my flood.",
        "Back off - I like being the underdog.",
        "No.  Abject terror is motivation enough.",
        "And fight with confidence?! That's suicide!",
        "What's a few injuries? I have endured this long, yes?",
        "I would prefer an unadulterated death, thanks.",

        "There is no glory in witchcraft and strange charms!",
        "Each wound earned is a lesson learned.",

        "Lucky thing for you I have dabbled in crochet!",
        "There, all patched up. That'll be five pence.",
        "If you perchance to snuff it, may I have your ring?",
        "I have packed your wounds with dung. Feel better?",
        "The bones of the vanquished make excellent splints, aye?",
        "That's a bad cut. Let me lick it clean.",
        "Did I wash this needle? Well, too late now.",
        "I cleaned the wound with the last of the wine. ... SIGH.",
        "I'm not fond of blood, but at least it's yours.",
        "Nasty ugly thing, this wound. It suits you.",
        "There. Now you will die much more slowly.",
        "Good. That should delay your death.",

        "Here we sit, the calm in the eye of the storm.",
        "I must be cautious when stretching my ligaments, lest they tear, of course.",
        "Pass this pipe around. The smoke dulls the senses.",
        "Why, I am documenting the journey, of course. Care to read?",
        "Some quiet, please. I am on the verge of breaking the cypher.",
        "Sigh... it is too dark to study my rituals here.",
        "Some bark of aspen? Or maybe boiled cerato leaf? Hmm...",
        "Hold that wound still. My sketch is nearly done.",
        "May I lance that boil? The pus is intriguingly gray!",
        "Busy yourself elsewhere. I am praying for your soul.",
        "Yes, I shave my legs. What of it?",
        "Have you thread? I've torn a seam in my temple garments.",
        "Leave me to reflect on the day's battles.",

        "Make room - there's a new player at the table!",
        "What game is this?  Where do I buy chips?",
        "Knucklebones, cards, or draughts. I care not as long as there is a fortune to be made.",

        "I feel healthier already.",
        "How many leeches does this really take?",
        "That curative salve smells like a gong farmer.",
        "I place my trust in your gnarled, warty hands.",
        "I really don't feel well at all...",
        "Such curious medicines - you're sure they will help?",
        "A stiff drink is all I need.",
        "Just get me a pint and I'll be right as rain.",
        "A pint will give me the peace I need.",
        "Bah!  I want to drink and be merry!",
        "That seems a bit bloody. How 'bout a stiff drink instead.",

        "I must meditate, clear my mind.",
        "The only response to adversity is acceptance.",
        "Peace, quiet, emptiness.  Find me a place to be alone.",
        "Only the peace of reflection can soothe my nerves.",
        "I need quiet communion with the all-guiding Light.",
        "The Light of prayer is all I need.",
        "Let me commune with the holy Light.",
        "The Light of prayer is all I need.",
        "Let me commune with the holy Light.",
        "Let the whip tear my flesh!",
        "Give me the embrace of the whip!",
        "I wish to gaze into puddles of my own blood!",
        "Give me pain, give me salvation!",
        "I must bleed, I must suffer!",
        "I've sworn off that poison.",
        "There's nothing in a bottle but regret.",
        "It's best I don't go in there. False allegations and all that.",
        "Uhhh...security's watching.  No thanks.",
        "They haven't let me in ever since the \u2026 \"incident.\"",
        "I'm not allowed in there.  Just a misunderstanding, I assure you.",

        "This could be the chance I've always deserved!",
        "I thought I saw something in the woods on the way here...",
        "Well, this place is...underwhelming.",
        "I'm ready to go!",
        "Gold and glory await? Count me in.",
        "I'm here for adventure. When does it start?",
        "When you say \"dangerous\", how dangerous do you mean?",
        "That road was rough and dark. Surely the worst is behind us.",
        "The journey here was ...unnerving.",
        "Let's do this.",
        "This place - so strange, like a dream.  Or a nightmare.",
        "If they bleed, we can kill them.",
        "I am undaunted by this oppressive atmosphere!",
        "Let's get started!",
        "I'm ready for anything.",
        "This is our time! I am prepared!",
        "I shall be a soldier against corruption!",
        "Why all the concern? I've seen nothing horrific.",
        "I'm prepared for what lies below.",
        "I was born for this.",
        "I am focused, ready for action.",
        "Send me out again!",
        "Anything is better than sitting around this dump.",
        "I yearn for adventure!",
        "I am restless.",
        "Choose me for the next expedition!",
        "Could use some time off.",
        "I'm fine, quit asking.",
        "A-alright, I can do one more run.",
        "Almost didn't make it last time...",
        "If I must return, I am ready.",
        "A break would be welcome, but I can go forth again if I am needed.",
        "I cannot take too many more like the last journey.",
        "I knew this would not be easy.",
        "P-please not again!",
        "I can't - I won't  go back!",
        "There is something terrible here, I can feel it!",
        "I can't get the horrible images out of my head...",
        "I need respite!",
        "It's too much, my head swims!",
        "I am in no shape to go back out there.",
        "The horrors I've seen. I do not know if I can handle any more.",
        "I need to do something to take my mind off of this.",
        "Drink, god, or dice. I care not what as long as it distracts me.",
        "Not another expedition -anything but that!",
        "I just cannot bear the thought of going back down there.",
        "I...cannot...go back.",
        "The next mission could mean my doom! I-I'm not ready.",
        "No...please don't send me.",
        "Surely someone else can go, instead?",
        "The beasts have followed us back to town! Look! The shadow!",
        "The others plot to kill me!",
        "Do NOT cast your gaze upon me! I know your foul intent!",
        "Why did I come to this hellish place...",
        "Send me down again, or not.  Nothing matters anymore.",
        "The future only holds death and bloodshed...",
        "Some of that gold should be coming back to me, for my efforts!",
        "Forge me new weapons and armor - I alone am worth the expense!",
        "I sacrifice and sacrifice, and where are my thanks?",
        "Why am I the only true hero here? INCOMPETENT FOOLS!",
        "If the rest of you don't start pulling your weight, I'll cut you free.",
        "Mewling lambs - all of you!",
        "Send me back down! I RELISH THE PAIN!",
        "Give me more scars. Test me again.",
        "Spend no gold on my armor - I wish to bleed!",
        "<glug glug>",
        "More wine, sir!",
        "Delicious, satisfying - MORE!",
        "Ahhh, it's so good when it hits your lips!",
        "Roll those dice again. This one is mine!",
        "I'm all in!  What a rush!",
        "Luck, be a lady tonight!",
        "Flip that card - Dog's Moon it is!",
        "Worth every coin!",
        "I-incredible!",
        "I'm not THAT flexible!",
        "Ack! A pulled muscle.",
        "Emptiness is the only defense against an assault on the mind.",
        "In through the nose, out through the mouth...",
        "Nothing within, nothing without...",
        "Flow and tranquility...",
        "Grant me the strength and peace of the Light.",
        "I submit myself to the highest power.",
        "Bless me, though I may be unworthy.",
        "The Light shows me how to defeat my enemies!",
        "AGAIN! Let it bleed! AGAIN!",
        "I live upon the razor's edge!",
        "THIS is for loss. THIS is for sin. THIS is for victory.",
        "The pain lets me see clearly!",
        "The room...it spins!",
        "I know, I know. This is for mine own good.",
        "More blankets!  N-no - fewer blankets!",
        "Unlock this door!  I am cured - or am I?!",
        "What is that ochre fluid?",
        "I have never seen leeches that large...",
        "Why three bedpans?",
        "I leave you to your ministrations...",
        "Ooof - it feels good to lie down.",
        "At lest, a chance to convalesce.",
        "This quest is beyond my experience.",
        "I fear this task is beyond me.",
        "N-no!  Not me!",
        "It's suicide!",
        "I wouldn't last a minute!",
        "I beg you - no!",
        "I can't - I won't!",
        "I won't waste my talents on that trivial errand.",
        "This quest is beneath my experience.",
        "Hah - such child's play is not the path to mastery!",
        "I must be challenged, if I am to improve.",
        "Feh - I am beyond this.",
        "Bother me not with such petty distractions.",
        "Without challenge, how am I to improve?",
        "I can't concentrate. Surely we will be set upon at any moment!",
        "I keep telling you there's NO TIME!",
        "They will SLAUGHTER US! We should go!",
        "...",
        "I cannot. The Light denies a disquieted soul.",
        "\"Anno domai vistu--\" Hold, what was that sound?!",
        "They are upon us! We should move, not sit about!",
        "Staying here is madness. I cannot countenance it.",
        "We should move on! They are still far too close!",
        "Please... let us rest quickly and get a move on.",
        "No... the spirits cannot hear me in this awful place.",
        "(heavy, panicked breathing)",
        "SHH! ... Growling, near to us... some fell beast...",
        "What?! I see eyes in the dark! Familiar eyes!",
        "(grunt) My hands shake like a rudder in a storm!",
        "No! We should flee, not stand about lolly-gagging!",
        "Are you mad?! There's no time for that!",
        "We're all going to die...",
        "We are come to the end - a finale of sorts.",
        "A white star, alone in the night-strong void.",
        "Such darkness... such darkness...",
        "The animal is still. Like a corpse. Awed by death.",
        "There are voices... You also hear them, yes?",
        "I cannot. My mind is occupied with preventing flight.",
        "You see that?! That is no natural mist!",
        "Unpack my supplies here? With creatures about!?",
        "No. My chemicals will attract the enemy.",
        "There's no time for that! They are nearly here!",
        "I... I cannot read the ritual while I shudder so...",
        "I am trying... but the Light denies a disquieted soul.",
        "There's no time for that. Evil is drawn to my purity.",
        "My mind obsesses over my last defeat.",
        "My will flees from the terror of this place.",
        "It takes my entire being not to flee this place!",
        "I cannot focus, my soul quakes.",
        "My hands shake so.",
        "I am vexed by the shadows.",
        "We need to save our strength in this horrible place!",
        "N-no, I must stay close to her.",
        "Every act brings us closer to our terrible fates!",
        "My hands shake too much!",
        "They are too near!",
        "Fear has slain my rational qualities!",
        "Trail?! There never was a trail! We hunt blindly in circles!",
        "I pray every moment that they will finish me quickly.",
        "Which is greater? The shame of quitting or the terror of Death itself?",
        "My mind is without anchor, I am awash in terror!",
        "I cannot find my inner locus... Leave me!",
        "Never let profit drive you! It twists the mind and warps intent!",
        "There are none here I can trust! They wait for me to close my eyes!",
        "Ha. I think not.",
        "Where is my cowl?! WHERRRE IS IT?!",
        "Forget it. They are not my allies...",
        "No... can't let the others see my holy rituals.",
        "I'll not produce my relics here! I may lose them!",
        "Absolutely not. The Verses forbid that.",
        "What foolishness! We should leave this place NOW!",
        "Oh yes... you would like that, wouldn't you?",
        "You're just trying to get at my purse. Shoo!",
        "Too late! They are coming for us! ARM YOURSELF!",
        "Aye, and with my back turned, no less?",
        "You cannot hide the animal hunger in your eyes...",
        "A magician never reveals his tricks.",

        "(laughs softly) I'll not deny my body its final rest.",
        "We have failed. But our bodies will feed so, so many...",
        "What cowardice.",
        "No. I shall at least die with some dignity.",
        "This old soldier knows this is his final skirmish.",
        "The omens are poor. We are finished either way.",

        "Onwards to my bloody ending.",
        "Trail leads here.  Here's where we stay.",
        "Time to face the music.",
        "Don't you see? If I die, WE die!",

        "Why? All these scars will look positively delightful!",
        "What? I was just starting to enjoy it!",
        "No! I've tasted death, and I want more!",
        "I've a victory tale for every scar. Why deny another?",
        "Sometimes victory costs more than one is willing to pay.",
        "I'm rather enjoying myself. So feck off.",
        "I prefer being stabbed over hearing you whine in the tavern.",
        "Getting beaten and humiliated is sort of my job. (sad laugh)",
        "No. Every fresh wound erases my memory of the last.",
        "Though it burns the eyes, is the sun not beautiful?",
        "Ha. Perhaps it is time I and It went our separate ways...",
        "Hmm. I find I rather like a little... humiliation. (grin)",
        "Every wound is the genesis of a new world.",

        "You bastards! You're TRYING to stain my coat, aren't you?",
        "The elders sent them to test us. Surely, we are doomed.",

        "AAGH! Somebody fouled up! The tip was a trap!",
        "Expedition my arse! More like extermination!",
        "GAH! ... Whose idea was this?? HUH??",

        "My time is short. Let us not waste it.",
        "Rather rough treatment for an honored scholar, no?",
        "(pained grunt) I am too old for this.",
        "Dammit! My vials are broken! That will cost extra!",
        "This was my favorite smock. Now you shall perish.",
        "For that, I claim your soul! FOR THE FLAME!",
        "Ungh! For these injuries, I require a greater fee!",
        "I require a bandage, NOW!",
        "They strike at the greatest threat!",
        "Tired of my unerring bolts eh?",
        "Only I could have survived that!",
        "And why did no one move to stop that?",
        "This would have felled a lesser being!",
        "If I can do this, then I certainly deserve more respect!",
        "Well don't just gawk, get me a bandage post-haste!",
        "My contract states I now qualify for an additional share!",
        "Pray I survive! Our fate hangs on it!",
        "Why was I not warned?!",
        "Every wound brings more glory!",
        "You'll miss me when I'm gone!",
        "Yes... more!",
        "HA! Fine work, friend!",
        "Yes, yes, NOW I'm awake!",
        "That one was for the Light.",
        "This persecution only strengthens my devotion!",
        "MMMmmmm. Hurts so good.",
        "You hit hard. I rather like that!",
        "(grinning snarl)",
        "Aye! Like two beasts in the dirt!",
        "Couple more of those and all pain will be a memory.",
        "Huh. Not bad. Not bad at all!",
        "Now here's an end worth singing about.",
        "Yes, don't leave me out. I deserve all I can get.",
        "Each wound takes me closer to bliss.",
        "Yes. Relieve me of this life. Do it.",
        "You cannot dissuade me. Not even your cruel weapons can.",
        "If you kill me, the black-beast will devour you. (grins)",
        "Yes... feed my blood to the crawling things!",
        "Fools. If my blood were to somehow penetrate your flesh...",
        "(deep inhale) Yes... again!",
        "It hurts, yes... But also... (blesses herself)",
        "More! MORE!",

        "No... dammit, no! How can I be so weak?!",
        "Dark spirits have blessed this one!",

        "That should have been the end of us!",
        "Suicide is the egress from all of this! I must die!",
        "I must perish so that it doesn't consume us all!",
        "I tire of keeping this hellbeast from taking over!",
        "Will it be over soon?!",
        "They will not cease until we lie in pieces!",
        "It is only a matter of time...",
        "That was a warning!",
        "Aaagh, I nearly perished!",
        "Bastard is after my coin! STAY BACK!",
        "You LET it come at me! TRAITOR!",
        "These ones hate the Light!",
        "Why are they attacking me? What have you done?!",
        "Oh blast. I've gone and riled that one.",
        "Why attack me?! How have I offended thee?!",
        "One solid blow like that and I am off to see the ancestors!",
        "It has vengeance in its eyes! How have I wronged thee?!",
        "This is no coincidence! They have been hunting me!",
        "I recognize this one! From a dark alley in town!",

        "They know my weaknesses!",
        "You all let this happen!",
        "How easily that one slipped through!",
        "And my cohorts conveniently slink away!",
        "Who is in league with whom?!",
        "This is the first maneuver by the conspirators!",
        "Hah! Come out of the shadows you scum!",
        "I suspected it! They have come for me!",
        "How did that slip through?!",
        "One of us stirs their wrath!",
        "A sign of disloyalty among us!",
        "Friend and foe mingle to conspire against me!",
        "So close to pain!",
        "No, NO! You pitiful thing!",
        "Come on, hit me! HIIIIT MEEEE!",
        "Show your worth! Spill my holy blood!",
        "Wretched fool! I judge you weak!",
        "You can do better, deary. Come now.",
        "Aaaaw... I was looking forward to that one.",
        "Weakness! Take my blood, or quit wasting my time!",
        "You dishonor me... Strike, or you can kill yourself!",
        "Come on! Just a wound or two to impress the lady-folk!",
        "(growl) Try a little higher next time!",
        "You pathetic creature. Can't even kill a suicidal clown.",
        "Go for the eyes next time.",
        "And life trudges onward, oblivious and stubborn.",
        "The fire takes the grass, but spares the rotting elm.",
        "And so I am forced to go on, I with my dark hitchhiker.",
        "You are fair pitiless, to spare a tainted old sorcerer.",
        "No... Kill me! Save me from myself!",
        "This death could be quick. A luxury in these times.",
        "Please, please! End this life of slavery! I BEG YOU!",
        "NOOO! The Flame calls to me! Send me to the Flame!",
        "Blazes, you were so close!",
        "Damn, I moved the wrong way.",

        "Oh you tease me!",
        "Oh you want me to beg for it!",
        "Not even a taste of sublime violent bliss?",
        "A free man never begs for what he can take, and I can take it!",
        "Next time make it count!",
        "Oaf, I'm right here!",
        "Oh come now, am I that hard to hit?",
        "Do you not recognize opportunity for mutual benefit?",
        "No! Try again! I will reward your accuracy!",
        "Give me cause to stitch my flesh!",
        "Don't steal my kills!",
        "That should have been mine!",
        "Hmph. You owe me one.",
        "Get out of my way! You're fouling up my aim!",
        "Aye yes... Just take all the glory, then.",
        "STOP! That one belongs to the Light!",
        "Honestly, how am I to earn a bonus with you around?",
        "Stop making it look so easy! Must keep our fees high...",
        "I don't understand... I thought I was the best...",
        "Stop hogging all the glory!",
        "Great, now step aside and let a professional in.",
        "Sigh. Is it my turn yet?",
        "Yes, you do all the hard work. I approve.",
        "I'm taking a nap. Let me know when it's safe.",
        "Good. Clearly, there's no need to overexert myself.",
        "You fight well. Handle things while I take a rest.",
        "See? It's easy when you have a teacher like myself.",
        "Good. The younger folk should indeed do most of the work.",
        "Don't damage the brain! I need a sample!",
        "Don't cut it up! I need it whole for my experiments!",
        "Let me kill it! Its soul must perish by my hand!",
        "Leave that one to me! I must cauterize its existence!",
        "I will decide who attacks whom!",
        "That was not my command!",
        "I had that one in my sights!",
        "I was about to fire!",
        "The reward will still be mine to claim!",
        "Respect our right to the quarry!",
        "I was just going to do that!",
        "Attacking out of turn again?",
        "I had distracted it for MY attack!",
        "I would have slain it!",
        "A clumsy blow to ruin the trophy!",
        "Thankfully I am the most valuable one here!",
        "My next blow will put that to shame!",
        "About time you did something useful.",
        "Hmph. A child could do better.",
        "You could have killed it, had you any skill.",
        "The faithless have no right to harm anyone...",
        "Pathetic. You lack the will of the Light...",
        "Good, but try aiming next time.",
        "Lovely. Now if only you could master the art of bathing.",
        "... If it were me, that would have been a killing blow.",
        "Yes, fine. Now step aside!",
        "Good. Not great. But good.",
        "Your dumb luck is holding, it seems.",
        "Enough flailing and the job gets done, apparently.",
        "Incredible. You hit one. Finally.",
        "Hmm. With training, you might prove competent.",
        "There are better ways to fill a teacup than with a storm...",
        "YOU THINK YOURSELF POWERFUL. BUT YOU ARE AN INSECT.",
        "MORTALS FIGHTING MORTALS. WHAT DULL AMUSEMENT.",
        "Butcher! Absolutely no precision at all.",
        "You make a better patient than a surgeon...",
        "Impressive. But the sacred fire grants superior power.",
        "... I could do better. Given half a chance.",
        "You are attacking out of turn!",
        "You dolt, never attack without knowing the plan!",
        "A clumsy blow.",
        "Such brutish flailing.",
        "I am the judge, the jury, and the gallows!",
        "My faithful hound - my sweet princess!  Tear at their flesh, that you may be adorned in bloody finery!",
        "Yes, aren't you just the slayer of beast and demon?",
        "I thought that one looked sickly.",
        "It appears to have tripped onto on your weapon.",
        "You threaten the hunt with your selfish attacks!",
        "You have enraged it! Let me finish it next time!",
        "Have you no other recourse?",
        "And now it will rage on the rest of us!",
        "We'll never get out of here if we fight like that!",
        "Some foul nightmare...",
        "We've got no chance... We should run!",
        "Light in heaven... What are we to do?",
        "The enemy is too strong! We must flee!",
        "You see?! They are powerful beyond measure!",
        "What madness brought us here?!",
        "The elders never warned me of such... evils.",
        "How can any warrior - man or woman - face such horrors...?",
        "Well... I think we've gone and snuffed it now.",
        "About that plan B I've heard so much about...",
        "It knows we're easy targets. We are sad, pathetic fools!",
        "Such hubris. We've practically killed ourselves!",
        "No... This is NOT how it's supposed to end.",
        "Vultures know our names. They have staked us out...",
        "We'll be picked off one by one! It is simple numbers!",
        "Knowledge of the afterlife will soon be mine...",
        "Death and dying feels so different on the receiving end...",
        "You failed. And now death comes for us all.",
        "No! NOOOO! Keep away from me!",
        "Now I know my end has come....",
        "Now it will slay us all!",
        "You stray from the plan!",
        "We are done for!",
        "Your failure has doomed us!",
        "The beginning of the end..!",
        "Terror shakes us all.",
        "That's it, stir the hornet's nest - fool!",
        "Why do you tempt fate, all of our fates, with this offense?!",
        "I am ready to flee, just give the signal.",
        "There is no slaying it! We must fly!",
        "The hunt is off, we are now the prey!",
        "I see us all dead, heads on stakes and bodies in cauldrons!",
        "We are caught in a trap of our own devising!",
        "Traitor! You missed on purpose!",
        "I knew it... You're with them!",
        "You backstabbing son of a...",
        "How did you miss?! Unless...",
        "You shall be judged for your failure...",
        "Oh, just come out with it! They paid you to miss!",
        "You can not deceive me, you wretch. You have betrayed us!",
        "The spirits have cursed you. Your very presence is death.",
        "You are possessed by a spirit of misfortune!",
        "... How much are they paying you?",
        "You do not trick me... You want us ALL dead!",
        "Ha! Only a traitor could have missed that shot!",
        "How did you miss? Tell me, before I cut the truth from you!",
        "Are you hiding booze? You must be drunk to miss like that!",
        "I think our ally is keeping secrets from us...",
        "No one - not even a child - could have missed that...",
        "That was not logical. What are you hiding?!",
        "Your deception has been found out. Traitor!",
        "Your trickery stands out like a rotting wound!",
        "I know a liar when I see one. You missed on purpose!",
        "Traitor! You could not have missed so easily! TRAITOR!",
        "Who among us has disturbed your aim?!",
        "You have sided with our enemies!",
        "Traitor!",
        "You betray us!",
        "Duplicity!",
        "What disgusting miming!",
        "What mimery to miss so!",
        "Are you the only one in league with them...?",
        "How did they tempt you into betrayal?",
        "What does it take to tempt one to fight alongside fiends?",
        "What a twisted will you must have to fight alongside them!",
        "That looked rehearesed!",
        "You are useless!",
        "You pathetic twit!",
        "Quit fooling about! Or I'll kill you myself...",
        "A curse upon you! The Light is displeased!",
        "Blasphemy! Your weakness offends the Light!",
        "Honestly, fish in a barrel have nothing to fear from you.",
        "My cat could put up a better fight. And he's dead.",
        "Stand aside. Let a true warrior through.",
        "Dishonor! You must fight with your heart! OR FAIL!",
        "... Have you considered a career in the carpentry arts?",
        "Not the BEST display I've seen. Possibly the worst.",
        "Good gods, get out of my way.",
        "I don't want to be here all daaaayyyyy!",
        "You do not paint a flattering picture of your kind...",
        "When we're done here, I'll teach you how to fight properly.",
        "I can hear It laughing at you... inside my mind.",
        "You are improving. Albeit slowly.",
        "No, NO! Where is your passion? Where is your focus?!",
        "I can see your potential! And yet you spurn it!?",
        "Eight year-old girls in the convent are better trained...",
        "I could fight better in my temple garments...",
        "You will have to answer for that!",
        "Cur! You gift them our very lives!",
        "Why do you even bother?",
        "Oh don't tease the enemy so.",
        "The hound should get your share!",
        "Untrained buffoons, all of you!",
        "How you pretended to be mighty!",
        "Untrained and dangerous to us all!",
        "Your wild swings are a threat to your own party!",
        "Did something shiny catch your eye? Pfah!",
        "Did no one tell you you only get one chance?",
        "Perhaps you lack the qualities needed.",
        "My death will be from your failure!",
        "Stupid child! You don't deserve your twenty-five percent!",
        "They should give me your share...",
        "I knew it! The Light is saving that one for redemption!",
        "Move aside! If you cannot prevail, then the Light shall!",
        "Good. I wanted that one for myself as is.",
        "If I kill it, do I get the pick of his loot?",
        "Stop fooling about! We are moving too slowly for my tastes!",
        "You're not working hard enough! Look to me for an example!",
        "We'll be here all night at this rate...",
        "Can we move things along? We're well past my bedtime.",
        "How the hell did you negotiate an equal share? Pffft.",
        "Booooo! I want my money back!",
        "Stand aside. This one is meant only for me... I can feel it.",
        "You should leave this one to the soldiers.",
        "Fascinating. I could write a paper on misfortune about you.",
        "Hold still... I want to fix your failure in my mind.",
        "Gods. Move over. Let me show you how a professional does it.",
        "You lack expertise, clearly. I can train you, for a fee...",
        "You know, for a donation, the Flame may grant you skill.",
        "Yes, distract that one while I do the real work.",
        "It all falls to me!",
        "I will show you how a true professional advances!",
        "I am not paid enough to fight for the both of us.",
        "I would have made that shot!",
        "We could have landed that!",
        "Feel free to sit this one out.",
        "If it survives to wound me, I shall return your favour.",
        "I cannot fight them all myself!",
        "Your miss throws my tactics into chaos!",
        "I only have enough powder to save myself!",
        "It always seems to fall to me, doesn't it?",
        "You forfeit your share of the loot!",
        "How can we all stand against that?",
        "No... NOOOOOO!",
        "RUUUUN!",
        "We are too weak.... pathetic in the eyes of the divine...",
        "It will kill us! We are doomed!",
        "Please... let us away! I see our deaths!",
        "I am too young to have my name etched in stone... (shudder)",
        "Why, spirits?! Why abandon us now, in the hour of our need?",
        "Please, ancestors... please grant me strength...",
        "Perhaps we should go? Yes, I vote for retreat.",
        "Let us be off! We can catch them up later!",
        "I should never have come out here...",
        "On second thought, children's birthdays aren't so bad...",
        "One step too far... one step and it's all over...",
        "Here it is. The end of my time. Finally...",
        "No!... I feel It coming through!...",
        "Keep away from me!... (grunt)... I cannot control It!",
        "Death is coming. The all-devourer, the all-destroyer...",
        "Here I am, death! CONSUME ME!",
        "No... No, please... (bursts into sobs)",
        "(tears streaming) Spare me... spare me... spare me...",
        "Spare them! I cannot bear to lose more men!",
        "This place is saving me for last.",
        "They will flay us one by one.",
        "Can my bolts stop this?",
        "That would have certainly sealed my demise.",
        "How much more blood does this place demand?!",
        "Keep yourself alive! If you fall...",
        "Don't just throw your life away! We need each other!",
        "Keep steady, damn you, I will not face them alone!",
        "Hold! Hold for the sake of us all!",
        "The grave's black maw will swallow us all!",
        "If you fall then our fate is sealed!",
        "Why aren't we fleeing?!",
        "How can we all stand against that?",
        "I told you! They know our weaknesses!",
        "Someone fouled up!",
        "The Light forsakes us? But why??",
        "The final judgment is soon upon us, I fear...",
        "It is as though they know our every move...",
        "I do not like this! They are too powerful!",
        "They smell our fear...",
        "They have hunted us! They know our weaknesses!",
        "Well, that's it. They've sussed us.",
        "Even if we win this, more will come.",
        "They bleed poison! Do not let it touch you!",
        "Smell that? It is sulphur! They are demon-anointed!",

        "I did not think we'd have it this bad...",
        "This is more daunting than I'd expected...",
        "What a nightmare this is becoming.",
        "I canst even think on our chances...",
        "Our resolve is strong!",
        "This is not so difficult after all.",
        "We are doing well. I had little doubt.",
        "The divine smiles on this day, it seems.",
        "This will be the easiest pay I've ever received.",
        "Another battle may be the end of us.",
        "We shall not survive... of that, I'm sure.",
        "We have paid for our folly in blood...",
        "A terrible price. What awful hubris.",
        "We must go on... though our chances are small.",
        "We are healthy and prepared for what may come.",
        "At least we have our health.",
        "Seems we are likely to survive. That's good, at least.",
        "No signs of illness or infected wounds. Good.",
        "At this rate, we should be home by dawn.",
        "My wounds are many and I feel weak.",
        "If I fall, don't leave my body here to rot.",
        "Just leave me here. I only slow you down.",
        "Is that fever...? Or am I merely bleeding out...",
        "I don't fancy my chances. Perhaps you could 'make it quick.'",
        "I am ready for battle. Let them come.",
        "Plenty of blood left to shed this day.",
        "I can feel my heart. It pumps strong.",
        "I feel strong and powerful. Let us carry on!",
        "I am blessed with good health. For today, at least.",
        "I've seen nothing I am not prepared for.",
        "Things are going according to plan.",
        "I am coping well, despite the madness all around.",
        "This place is horrific... E'en so, I am  at ease.",
        "It looks bad, but there is nothing to fear here.",
        "My head swims and the horrors mount.",
        "The rigors of this journey...are nearly too much for me.",
        "I don't think I can take much more...",
        "I am not myself... Please, forgive me.",
        "You must forgive me... this place -- it is getting to me.",
        "We are healthy and mentally steeled for this challenge!",
        "We are favored by the gods this day.",
        "Blessed are we, that no fear has o'ertaken us.",
        "We are as straight-backed as a royal guard. Good.",
        "We are the flame!",
        "Our wounds are many and even our courage hangs by a thread!",
        "We have strayed too far, and we shall soon pay the price.",
        "We must return to town... Please, listen to me!",
        "I beg you... turn back! I have suffered and seen too much!",
        "Hopeless. The mission is utterly hopeless.",
        "Our provisions run low. This journey best not last much longer.",
        "Already my stomach aches. We will not survive...",
        "So hungry. Why do we not turn back?",
        "Hunting here seems futile. All meat is surely tainted.",
        "Perhaps we could forage some berries? ... No?",
        "Cheer up. Things will get better.",
        "We seem... capable enough.",
        "We'll survive. This I know.",
        "The odds seem to be in our favour.",
        "I've led more difficult charges than this.",
        "Justice is on my side. No evil can stand against that.",
        "One need merely avoid the shadows to stand in the Light.",
        "Think of the treasure, sweethearts! All gleam and gold!",
        "It's just another graveyard. I've plundered hundreds.",
        "You all look a fright. Pat yourselves down... Better.",
        "Keep your weapons a'readied. This is rule number one.",
        "I have sharpened our steels. We could skin a turtle.",
        "We'll survive... if we submit to the beast inside.",
        "Just keep your blade sharp and musket loaded. T'is all.",
        "In, out, and home... though all the richer.",
        "Let's press on. Things go pear-shaped, we flee.",
        "If we're all going to die, let's at least enjoy it.",
        "What's the deal with pinapple?  Am I right?",
        "Here's what I think of our enemies: HA HAA HAAAA!",
        "If I've survived this long, so can you all.",
        "Do not dwell on your end. Think instead of today.",
        "Wine, song, naked feet. Fresh dew in springtime.",
        "We must work together, as the tribal-folk do.",
        "You must distract your mind. Think of happier times.",
        "I know a rite for this. It will calm you.",
        "We can cure this place's ills. We are its medicine.",
        "Like a vaccine, we shall inoculate this land against evil!",
        "Fear wears off in time. Much like a mild poison.",
        "The Light touches us even here.",
        "I see victory in your eyes, though you are blind to it.",
        "Verse LVI: The Light e'er rises.",
        "We are strong together, hold fast!",
        "You execute maneuvers well!",
        "Stick to the plan and we will survive.",
        "I will show you a trick of the will I learned in my travels.",
        "Be calm, my arbalest will slay those who threaten.",
        "If it bleeds, we can slay it.",
        "The hound has the trail. We are certain to succeed.",
        "Every brigand, every miscreant is terrified of those who serve law and order.",
        "We work together, stay focused.  We'll get out of this mess.",
        "Will is stronger than hope. Believe me.",
        "I can sense the strength within you.",
        "Find your core, hold fast to your convictions!",
        "This is only a bit of excitement, think of the tales they'll tell!",
        "Think of how they'll cheer and toast us back in the Hamlet!",
        "This is the glory we have been hunting!",
        "Just imagine those cool, thick pieces of gold tumbling into your hands!",
        "Fear is just a bedtime tale we scare ourselves with.",
        "Gaze into the fire and gather your inner strength!",
        "Even towering beasts can be killed with a well-placed blow.",
        "There is no trail I cannot follow.",
        "My friends, we can pass any test. Do not despair!",
        "Remain vigiliant, my friend!",
        "Forget not that our errand is holy and just! Light will prevail!",
        "Light, grant me the strength to overcome whatever appears in our path.",
        "I...borrowed...this when we were in town.",
        "...much better.",
        "Naught but my own blade will find the heart of these monstrosities!",
        "<whistles>",
        "With my ear to the road, none shall surprise us...",
        "Why should we fret? We'll all be worms soon enough.",
        "My friend, the Light shines upon you!",
        "...Divine Light...Purest Grace...be with us now.",
        "Let us all bow our heads in prayer...",
        "Let safety be upon us...let us be veiled in holy Light.",
        "Look at this fool, this imbecile!  Playing the hero, are you?! Ha-HAA",
        "The draft of air upon my face...intoxicating...",
        "Even great wounds are treatable. Get back in this fight.",
        "If we learn to move in ordered fashion, we will fight better together.",
        "Skill always trumps raw strength. Strike like so...",
        "The key to a continued heartbeat is to MOVE YOUR FEET.",
        "You have nothing to fear, my friends. The beast is not for you.",
        "There is no greater poison than what already flows in my veins.",
        "I can feel it!",
        "Let's not linger.",
        "Forward!",
        "Let's find some things to kill.",
        "Treasure ahead, I'd wager!",
        "Time to move.",
        "March, friends!",
        "We should keep moving.",
        "Let's go.",
        "Hold up!",
        "Halt!",
        "Wait - let's collect ourselves.",
        "Hmmm, where next?",
        "Shhh!",
        "Careful!",
        "Stay calm! This is not a rout!",
        "Stop stepping on my feet!",
        "What if we're ambushed like this?!",
        "Is anyone checking behind us?",
        "This expedition is doomed!",
        "This cannot continue...",
        "*breathes heavily*",
        "I...this...can't...",
        "We have seen such horrors already!",
        "We shall not survive. This I know.",
        "It gnaws at the back of my mind...",
        "What are we doing?",
        "W-we should run!",
        "*gasp!*",
        "I don't like this...",
        "I-I don't want to die here!",
        "It's over for us - over!",
        "My wounds are mounting.",
        "Heal me!",
        "Unnngh!",
        "I need a healer!",
        "Argh!",
        "Blast!",
        "Yaargh!",
        "Steady, my friend!",
        "Shake it off!",
        "Do not fall!",
        "W-what grievous injury!",
        "Brace up!",
        "Are you alright?",
        "Steel yourself!",
        "I fear I'm lost!",
        "I see only swirling blackness!",
        "Is this to be my last battle?",
        "A warrior's death awaits me!",
        "An end to my torment, at last?",
        "Every road ends...",
        "One last throw of the dice...",
        "If I fall...don't put me in the ground.",
        "At last, the greatest joke of all...",
        "All flesh fails, in the fullness of time.",
        "I am ready, Light!",
        "This was not the deal we struck!",
        "No! Do not fall!",
        "We will save you!",
        "You cannot die. We need you!",
        "Someone - HELP!",
        "Back from the edge, comrade!",
        "Hold fast!",
        "I'm not giving up!",
        "My vision clears!",
        "My thread winds on!",
        "The grave can wait!",
        "My friend--you shall not fall today!",
        "Hold fast, friend, you are still with us!",
        "Easy, easy, you're not gone yet!",
        "Stay with us!",
        "You still stand, fight on!",
        "My veins are on fire!",
        "I...feel...faint",
        "My heart will burst!",
        "It eats away at my flesh!",
        "Antivenom!  NOW!",
        "My skin burns!",
        "Can't staunch the flow...",
        "There will be no blood left for the leeches!",
        "Everything runs red...",
        "So much...blood...",
        "I need a bandage!",
        "I...bleed...",
        "These beasts will fight harder in the dark.",
        "We must keep our courage up despite this bleakness.",
        "Dim, dark, bright, or day... our task is the same.",
        "Shall we skulk in the dark like monsters ourselves?",
        "All this darkness, perfect for an ambush...",
        "Watch your feet in this murk.",
        "Hrm, hard to see.",
        "Careful now.",
        "Watch your step.",
        "It's easier if you squint...",
        "This infernal blackness\u2026I can't see my own feet!",
        "Dark is their ally!",
        "We can use this blackness against them. Strike before they see it.",
        "Are there any torches left?",
        "Now our enemy's back is up against it. We must remain steadfast."
